# Mediassist
it is a project made by me for Hackamu 2
* I tried to provide a solution of tracing of nearby hospitals and health centres located in a society during this global panedamic. It's a platform where hospitals can add their locations,facilities and more
 whereas patients can book their appointment in nearby hospitals  by looking at its current availability..
